# Analysis of Alert Patterns and Factors in ADAS for Enhanced Road Safety

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of various alert patterns and their underlying factors in a fleet of vehicles equipped with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), with a keen focus on enhancing road safety. The study explores the correlation between weekly workloads and alerts, the impact of festivals on alert rates, weather-adaptive safety solutions, and the influence of external events on traffic alert patterns. Additionally, it delves into driver adaptation, alert patterns, and parking skills, shedding light on issues related to lane departures, headway monitoring, and pedestrian collision warnings, all contributing to road safety.

Notably, this report goes beyond the initial dataset by introducing additional columns, yielding new and insightful findings. These additional insights are presented in the final five sections of the report, shedding light on critical aspects of the data analysis that directly impact road safety.
